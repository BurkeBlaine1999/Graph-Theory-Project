What is Thompson's construction
------------------------------------------------
Thompson's construction algorithm is a method of transforming a regular expression into an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA).
This NFA can be used to match strings against the regular expression.

NON-deterministic finite automaton (NFA)
------------------------------------------------
A NON-deterministic finite automaton
lets you try all possible choices in
parallel. If any choice leads you to the
accept state, it will work.

An NFA accepts a string x if it can get
to an accepting state on input x

An nfa consumes a string of symbols that are inputted. 
For all symbols it transitions to a new state till all are consumed.

If it comes to stage where there are two or more applicable transitions
it will make a clone of itself and all clones follow a different transition.

If there are NO applicable transitions , it has come to a dead end and dies.
